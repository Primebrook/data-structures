Data Stuctures, their operations and tests.

This program runs tests on the data structures and their operations. 

Dependencies: 

    - Clang
    - make
    - clang-format

In the root directory:

1. Run `make` to build the project.
2. Run `make run` to run the program (which is just running the test suite atm).

I'm using `clang-format` to format the code. It can be installed with homebrew with `brew install clang-format`.
To run the formatter run `make format`.
